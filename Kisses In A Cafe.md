# Kisses In A Cafe

## Verse 1

	G Em Am Dsus2
	damnit we're back to square one - a fight that I thought I had won
	G Em Am Dsus2
	we're turning in circles again - you say something you don't really mean

	Am H7 G A7
	as I'm about to cry - something catches your eye
	Cm G D D
	I follow your gaze and explode

## Verse 2

	watching these young fools over there - just like we used to be
	careless and totally lost in some sort of saliva spree

	it's close to impossible remaining focused on us
	when instead we can witness first love

## Verse 3

	first base accomplished, well done - a recap of how we'd begun
	we've had so many bases since then - and still we're facing the end

	as I'm about to cry - something catches your eye
	I swallow my pain and refrain

## Verse 4

	the posh lady having boiled egg - gets humped by a dog up her leg
	i've read once that this is a thing - letting your dog blow off steam

	it's close to impossible remaining focused on us
	when instead we can witness canine love
