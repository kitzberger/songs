# Procrastination

Capo IV

## Chorus

	F   Bbmaj7  C4  F
	Bb  Am      Gm  C

	Today I didn’t do much
	But scroll up and down
	That's not exactly that
	What I am paid for

## Verse 1

	F Dm Gm C

	First I got some coffee - which helped me to realize
	that I forgot the milk - so I went back

	ain't it funny how a fully automatic coffee maker
	needs an awful lot of manual operations to perform

	such a simple task of brewing me my morning coffee
	with just a little milk and not too strong

## Pre-Chorus

	A4 Gm
	C G4 A4 Bb2

	i'd like to think of myself as a team player
	but still I walked away when it said run the cleanup now

## Chorus

## Verse 2

	i was only half way through fighting off those mails
	while my colleagues had already left for their lunch break

	and rushing down the corridor I passed that cute intern
	i got confused and asked her for the way

	'please don't let me be like him when i am in my 30ies'
	it hurt hearing her saying that as I turned away

## Pre-Chorus

	i do hope assisting helpless collegues makes her feels a bit
	as if she's working for one of those NGO

## Chorus

## Verse 3

	I bet even my boss - if she was fully honest
	Would rather not get up if she was me

	The other day I saw her almost having second thoughts
	before she gave that shitty task to me

	after one extensive stay on the loo
	i highscored at candy crash

## Pre-Chorus

	I even tried a smoothie with organic lemon gras
	but still i felt no different 'bout these excel sheets

## Chorus

	Today I didn’t do much
	But scroll up and down
	Not exactly that
	What I am paid for

## Final Chorus

	The most creative task today
	way writing down my times
	and thinking of a text
	without lying
