# Monstertrucks

Capo II

## Intro

	F#m Dmaj7 E7add4 C#7

## Part A ("Verse")

	F#m Dmaj7 E7add4 C#7

	I just don't care for monster trucks
	you can call this ignorant but who gives a fuck

	when you called me with excitement in your voice
	telling me about that show, you left me no choice

	but to cancel all appointments and to cancel all that's left
	and wipe out every proof of it and this gives you the rest

	without my sense of taste i can't be what you need
	you have to ask somebody else if they would like to bleed

## Part B

	F#m Dmaj7 E4
	i cannot bare those stitches
	F#m Dmaj7 E
	i just can't take 'em out
	F#m Dmaj7 E4
	excuse me i'm the wrong guy
	F#m Dmaj7 E
	and i take the nearest route

## Part C ("Pre-Chorus")

	F#m Dmaj7 E7add4 C#7

	to the underground - to the underground
	can't be found - in the underground

## Part D ("Chorus")

	A          E
	     in 1993
	                 F#m
	a woman came to me
	                               C#m        E
	and kissed me right infront of eeeeeeeveryone
	A          E
	     in 2003
	                   F#m
	that woman texted me and said

	she's sorry it's not gooooooonna work
