# Lumpeks

## Intro (instrumental verse)

## Verse

	D G Hm A
	G C Em D

	it's called lumpeks - when you walk around
	in fancy clothes that you've just found
	in that 2nd hand market that's right next to your place

	it's a lumpeks party when all of your friends
	do the same mistake and everyone pretends
	that this old rag is the best you've dressed all year

## Chorus

	Hm A D G D A     Hm A D G A D
	Em D G C G D     Em D G C D G

	whoa oh oh - whoa-uh-oh-uh-ohhhh
	whoa oh oh - whoa-uh-oh-uh-ohhhh

## Solo

## Verse

	it's called a meeting - cause your laptop says so
	hide the bottles and put on some clothes
	at least for the upper half of your hungover self

	let's call it network failure when after a while
	your webcam freezes and you give up tryin'
	to reconnect and instead to it a day

## Chorus

	whoa oh oh ...
