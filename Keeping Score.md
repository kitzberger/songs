# Keeping Score

Capo 2

## Pre-Verse

	G G C C
	D D G G

## Verse 1

	G G
	talking about our latest fight
	C C
	i am almost sure that i've won
	D D
	but then you remind me keeping score when fighting
	D G
	is childish and really dumb

	of course you're right - I apologize
	we agree on no one's to blame
	but to make it worthwhile I open that file
	and put a strike next to your name

## Pre-Verse

## Verse 2

	there's one big ass vehicle
	that's blocking the bicycle lane
	i feel frustrated because i know later
	we're gonna miss the train

	but then I'm gonna report that prick
	to some cycling activists
	and they're gonna track him and probably smack in
	the side windows of his
	
## Chorus

	C C D D
	who am i to say i'm better than you
	G G C C
	who are you to say it's you
	Am Am D D
	for all we know it's much more complicated
	G G C
	none of us just owns the truth

## Post-Chorus

	F C F C F C G
	F C F C F C D
	
## Pre-Verse

## Verse 3

	of course i've watched that brand new show
	all the fuzz is about on the web
	though it took me some time to get every line
	in that mumbled dialect

	G G
	no, i can't stay for movie night
	C C
	i don't watch no overdubs
	D D
	the voices so fake - they - for christ's sake
	D C
	cause me to throw up

## Bridge

	Em F C G
	Em F C G

## Verse 4

	alright, I'll stay - let's talk about
	what we would like to eat
	I'm fine with everything you say
	unless it's based on meat
	
	and while we're on that subject, i would
	like to share with you
	some insights about CO2 and
	every little thing that you do
