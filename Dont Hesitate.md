# Don't Hesitate

## Intro

	Bb G# Bb D# Bb G# Bb

## Verse

	Bb G# Bb
	I don't see why this is
	i don't see why you don't kiss
	i mean she's got the lips
	and so do you

	she's got the weirdest look
	each time she tries to shook
	her head against the wall
	             C#     Bb
	she's coming on to you

## Chorus

	F#                                  F
	this is the one thing that's worth fighting back your fears
	F#                                     F
	this is the one thing that i've been thinking about for years

## Verse

	don't hesitate, i'll be fine
	don't hesitate, i'm alright
	i'm not afraid, not at all
	so just get it on

	she dares another glance
	i guess she likes you to dance
	and feel your body close
	             C#     Bb
	she's coming on to you

## Refrain

## Outro (Rocknroll)
