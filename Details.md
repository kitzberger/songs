## Intro

	Am    Em    F     C
	Am7/C Fsus2 G     G

## Verse

	the places that you've been to seem to slowly fade away
	the stories you once told are long gone
	i remember well this little song you taught us kids
	not to worry when we're feeling all alone

## Intermezzo

## Verse

	last time i came by you had a hard time figuring out
	who precisely i could be to you
	eventually you went with the name of our dog
	fine by me - i know she meant a lot to you

## Chorus

	 F                   G
	so you forgot a few details lately
	       C                            F
	that's OK, it's not the end of the world
	F                           G
	all the great minds have a lousy name memory
	    C                      F
	at least as far as i'm concerned
	   G                 Am
	i rarely remember anyone
	       G                 C
	like grandma, like grandson

## Intermezzo

## Verse

	at some point i stopped asking about the wonders of the world
	juvenile ignorance for sure
	but you reached out and asked if i might find some time to spare
	and explain the world wide web to you

	oh, i probably said something like it is just the dopest thing
	a little like a library, you know?
	and you can stay in touch with your beloved family
	in case one day they choose to live abroad

## Chorus

## Bridge Instrumental

	DÂ°
	Cm G# Fm Gm

## Bridge Verse

	Cm G# Fm Gm

	my whole generation benefits from what you've built
	still we're struggling with filling your shoes
	how come there is nowadays fact alternatives
	and mainstream media vs. fake news

## Verse

	it's tough when after years of being convinced there's common sense
	you find the world has seemingly gone mad
	every other week on the front pages one can read
	of another shooting and black body bags

## Chorus

	so you don't follow the news reports lately
	that's OK - you must've heard it all before
	the demons of the past - back in the parliaments
	and they behave as if they've never heard of war
	stupid agitations, mean and loud
	kinda relieved you're slowly zoning out
