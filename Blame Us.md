### Intro

	G   G   H7  H7
	C   C   G   G

### Verse

	I'm sitting here coz i got nowhere else to be
	feel free to join me if you please
	we would be the two sitting in the shade
	don't blame me for nodding off under these trees

### Pre Chorus

	E   E   Am  Am
	oh i hope that we don't die, there's so much more to see,
	G   G   D   D
	if we did this'd be one shitty afternoon

### Chorus
	   C              H7

	at least i'm free to say
	      C           D               G
	that no one ever saw this coming near

### Verse

	i'm glad you're here in this with me together
	since you're one of the few i really trust
	do you recall the times we were sixteen years of age
	and failed to hitch a ride to the next town

### Pre Chorus

	even though we stood for hours in the rain and caught a cold
	we had never lost the faith in getting back

### Chorus

	without one having said
	we both know it's been the best
	time of our lifes we ever had

### Verse

	please tell me again of how we got out of this trouble
	this one time we had way too much to drink
	i felt kinda dizzy and you couldn't quite remember
	the straight way back to your girlfriends place

### Pre Chorus

	still we somehow managed to get back without a scratch
	otherwise this would have been one shitty trip to rome

### Chorus

	     C           H7
	when i recall today
	  E4    C       G
	i only have to say
	    C               D             G
	we never have been happier than this

### Outro (normal)

	C G
	i'm expecting you to
	C G
	call me on the phone
	C G
	and you're expecting me
	D
	to do the very same

	we're expecting each other
	to walk right thru the door
	and i'm calling you
	any day now

### Outro (x-mas version)

	if only we could see
	where all of us would be
	if only we were
	a little closer

	i'm expecting jesus
	to walk right thru this door
	i'm expecting jesus
	any day now

### Final Outro

	G C D
	any day, aaaany day, any day
	any day, aaaany day, any day
	any day, aaaany day, any day
	any day, aaaany day, any day
	G
