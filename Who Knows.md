		  C9          D            G
	and then no one even cares to say hi

### Verse 2

	or maybe you wonder why you've only been

	  well, it's not always been that way
	    G             F            C

	i assure you they'd been pretty cool
	i know that__ for a fact

### Verse 3

	but they only had football in mind
	then i tell you screw them and do as you please
	get some dancing shoes and start to shine

### Verse 4

	in 2029 it's not that big-a-deal
	to be with the person you like

	don't approve, move out, it's 'bout time

### Chorus

	F                        C
	  well, it's not always been that way

	i guess if they're all acting weird now
		   G                  F          C
	then it's you who messed them up pretty bad

	they used to be pretty kick ass
	        F              C
	i guess if they're all acting weird now
		   G             F            C
