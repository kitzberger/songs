# Secrets Of Your Life (2018)

## Verse

	Am Dm7 G7 C7

	a little birdy told me you've received my gif
	and i'm still waiting on how you react

	meanwhile you found the time to like some other crap
	a guy you barely know had put online

## Pre-Chorus

	F Fm C G
	Oh yes i've put my mind on you

	D# F Bb F
	and i know exactly what you do

## Chorus

	Cm G# D# Bb

	all of your fantasies
	all of your dreams
	all of your secrets
	and all that you feel

	i know all your secrets
	the darkests of all
	i'd never expose them
	if you tell me more

## Verse

	do you remember that time you called in sick
	and spend 5 days in vienna with that girl

	maybe your boss still doesn't have a clue
	and didn't see those pictures on your feed

## Pre-Chorus

	Oh yes i've put my mind on you
	and i have subscribed to what you do

## Chorus

## Verse

	what that you say? you don't like being stalked?
	then why didn't you say so beforehand?
	
	simply click here and then scroll down a bit
	browse to that section that no one ever reads
	
## Pre-Chorus

	Oh yes, i've put my mind on you
	so what's it that you're gonna do?
