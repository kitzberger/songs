## Verse 1

```
A G#m F#m E
It came to me as a surprise
and to be honest I would've chosen differently
there's plenty fish in the sea
and now you're stuck - stuck with me
```

## Verse 2

```
It came to me as a surprise
and most people would probably agree
but that's the thing about you
you're not most people - lucky me
```

## Chorus

```
Had been sitting on my own
I convinced myself that is what I want
never had it crossed my mind
I give in the second that you came along
```

## Verse 3

```
the way your eyes had locked with mine
it's been excluding - everybody else
could not have cared less if i tried
and those freckles - did not exactly help
```
