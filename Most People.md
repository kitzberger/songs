# Most People

## Verse 1

```
It came to me as a surprise
and most people would probably agree
but that's the thing about you
you're not most people - lucky me
```

## Chorus

```
Had been sitting on my own
I convinced myself that's what I want
it just never crossed my mind
I'd give in the second you would come along
```

## Verse 2

```
The way your eyes had locked with mine
it's been excluding - everybody else
could not have cared less if i tried
and those laugh lines did not exactly help
```

## Chorus

## Verse 3 + 4

```
It's getting late, I dare to ask
for your number but you just shake your head
you smile and let me know that you
don't have a phone - how cool is that?

On local farms, so you found out
they use more pesticides than allowed
the way you're angry about that
is so damn hot - kiss me now
```

## Chorus

```
Had been sitting on my own
I convinced myself that's what I want
it just never crossed my mind
I'd give in the second you would come along
```

## Intermezzo

## Bridge
```
A
It came to me as a surprise
and to be honest I would've chosen differently
F#m
there's plenty fish in the sea
and yet you chose - to skinny dip with me
```
