# This World

Capo 2

## Verse 1

	D/F# Em7/G
	youuu came into this world all alone
	D/F# A7/F#
	you were naked and you didn't speak a word

	surely you've had your suspisions from the start
	as a species we're kind of the worst

	Bm/A F#m/C# G6 Em7/G
	there's people that have way to much while others don't own anything
	D/F# Em7/G
	so if you've got ideas how to change that
	A A7 D
	do not hesitate - and throw'em in

## Verse 2

	even though we all agree on basic human rights
	equal pay still seems to many as a crime

	funny coz I'm pretty sure most people would agree
	sherwood forest beats the wall street anytime

	there's people that don't know where to park their giant vehicle
	so if you've got ideas how to change that
	do not hesitate - we're all ears

## Chorus 1

	Gmaj7 D
	well certainly not all of us
	B7 E7
	some still ride the market bus
	A A7 D D7
	guess they do believe in fairies too

## Verse 3

	somehow we tend to harm the ones we love the most
	take everybodies favorite animal
	the dodo which was last seen 4 hundred years ago
	but then some genius shot the very last

	Bm F#m G A
	I'm sure they didn't know their number was that low
	D A Em Em
	and killing just one more could mean extinction
	A A7 D
	and an afterlife - in cartoons

## Chorus 2+3

	Gmaj7 D
	and maybe if I dare to say
	B7 E7
	they're better off extinct today
	A A7 D D7
	who knows what MacDonalds would've done

	Oh, if they'd gotten hold of one
	turned them into a breeding farm
	sold their round behinds for 1,99
