# This World

Capo 2

## Verse 1

	D/F# Em7/G
	you came into this world all alone
	D/F# A7/F#
	you were naked and you didn't speak a word

	surely you've had your suspicions from the start
	as a species we're kind of the worst

	Bm/A F#m/C# G6 Em7/G
	there's people that have way too much while others don't own anything
	D/F# Em7/G
	so if you've got ideas how to change that
	A A7 D
	do not hesitate - and throw'em in

## Verse 2

	even though we all agree on basic human rights
	equal pay still seems to many as a crime

	funny coz I'm pretty sure most people would agree
	sherwood forest beats wall street anytime

	there's people that don't know where to park their giant vehicle
	so if you've got ideas how to change that
	do not hesitate - we're all ears

## Chorus 1

	Gmaj7 D
	well certainly not all of us
	B7 E7
	some still ride the market bus
	A A7 D D7
	guess they do believe in fairies too

	the ones that slash the top tax rate
	that actually could've changed our fate
	can't believe that's still an issue


## Verse 3

	somehow we tend to harm the ones we love the most
	take everybody's favorite animal
	the dodo which was last seen 4 hundred years ago
	but then some genius shot the very last

	I'm sure they didn't know their number was that low
	and killing just one more could mean extinction
	and an afterlife - in cartoons

## Chorus 2+3

	and maybe if I dare to say
	they're better off extinct today
	who knows what MacDonalds would've done

	if they had gotten hold of one
	they would've gone all cross-breed farm
	and sold their round behinds for 1,99
