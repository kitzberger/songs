Capo VI

### Verse 1

	G                            C
	in order to not getting you mad or anything
	G                          D
	i keep using these stupid pads for my drinks
	        G                             C
	that i did not open up with a fork or any other tools
	        G               D                    G
	coz i know that around here we've got these rules

### Verse 2

	like for instance not to put any ice cubes into your rum
	or to try and close that door entirely like anyone
	in their right mind would do, no, that's why i don't even try
	to talk back to you coz after all you're right

### Chorus 1

	                 C            G            D
	these rules are not just made up, they're totally real
	         C            G                 D
	they're not just made up, they are the biggest deal
	         C            G             D
	they're not just made up, it's our destiny
	    C          G                D
	without these rules it's almost anarchy

### Verse 3

	another thing that's crucial is to not close any tabs
	in your browser coz that's how you feel organized, perhaps
	this is linked to your childhood when your mommy didn't tell
	you how to buy a couch that doesn't hurt like hell

### Verse 4

	in order to not giving you a heart attact tonite
	we made sure all guests are on the right track, that's right
	there's a test that we put up and every one that's coming late
	had to take an extra class so they won't misbehave

### Chorus 2

	they're not just made up, they're totally cool
	they're not just made up, i think they're chick magnets too
	they're not just made up. rules help control the fun
	but one step out of line, you pull the nerf gun

### Verse 5

	oh, wait, there's more stuff that is simply not allowed
	one is counting score in card games - out loud
	the other one talking to you with default leveled voice
	at concerts where your earplugs filter noize

### Verse 6

	even though it feels like tyranny, you care for all your guests
	you only rule with an iron fist coz you want our best â€“ so if
	someone thinks that doctor who's a star wars remake
	please have merci, it's a wookie mistake

### Chorus 3

	these rules are not just made up, they're written in stone
	some people say you won the game of throwns
	so when you ask if we'd like wine or grappa
	the only valid response is - ja, papa
