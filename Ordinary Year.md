# Ordinary Year

Capo 7 (Gitarre)
Capo 2 (Mandola)

## Intro

	C G F

## Verse

	C G F C F C D7 G4 G

	Tomorrow I'll start planning
	as if there's no pandemic
	and this was just an ordinary year

	Might even send out save the dates
	coz that's the way you do it
	when you're about to reach out for the stars

## Chorus

	Em     Am                F        C
	    I hope you guys can manage
	       Dm                 C              G       G7
	 it's way too long since we have spoken last
	Em     Am           F        C
	    I vaguely do remember
	       Dm               C              G
	    we used to say someday we will go back

## Verse

	No worries if you're rusty
	we all feel out of practice
	but you will receive instructions in advance

	I expect you to be fluent
	in ancient greeting rituals
	such as shaking hands like it's still 2019

## Chorus

	Am     Dm                Bb       F
	    I hope you guys can manage
	       Gm                 F              C       C7
	 it's way too long since we have been outside
	Am     Dm           Bb       F
	    I vaguely do remember
	       Gm                  F                C
	    your stupid face and what's it looking like
	
## Verse

	At first it may feel funny
	and there might be situations
	when you wish someone else would choose for you
	
	i guess that going vegan
	could simplify that matter
	in restaurants only one choice left for you
